// Default Setup Template
// This file serves as a starting point for building a simple Vapor application.
// It demonstrates a basic setup, including an endpoint for testing.
// You can modify or extend this template as needed for specific project iterations.

import Vapor // Import Vapor framework for building server-side Swift applications.

// MARK: - Application Initialization
// Create an instance of the Vapor Application configured for development.
var app = Application(.development)

// Use defer to ensure the application shuts down gracefully when the script ends.
defer { app.shutdown() }

// MARK: - Route Definitions
// Define a simple GET endpoint at "/setup".
// When accessed, this endpoint returns a success message.
app.get("setup") { req in
    // This closure handles incoming requests to the "/setup" route.
    // It returns a simple message confirming the setup execution.
    return "Setup executed successfully!"
}

// MARK: - Application Execution
// Run the application.
// The `try` keyword indicates that this operation may throw an error, 
// which must be handled appropriately.
try app.run()

// MARK: - Notes
// 1. This template serves as a baseline for testing setup-related tasks.
// 2. The `/setup` route can be replaced or extended to implement specific features.
// 3. For production use, replace `.development` with `.production` in the application initialization.
// 4. If additional middleware or configurations are required, they should be added before `app.run()`.

// Example:
// app.middleware.use(MyCustomMiddleware())
