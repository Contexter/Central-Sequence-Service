# Simplified Approach to Iteration Execution in CentralSequenceService

This document provides a comprehensive tutorial for managing and executing iteration logic in the CentralSequenceService application. It includes a summary of earlier failed approaches and how we arrived at this simplified, robust method.

---

## **Background**

The CentralSequenceService application is designed to handle multiple iterations, each implementing specific logic. Initial attempts to dynamically execute iterations faced several challenges:

1. **Environment Variable Strategy**:
   - Relied on `Environment.get("ITERATION")` or command-line arguments.
   - Failed due to segmentation faults and difficulties in debugging.
   - Introduced unnecessary complexity in setup and testing.

2. **Command-Line Argument Parsing**:
   - While functional, it proved cumbersome to debug and added unnecessary dependencies.

These approaches highlighted the need for simplicity, reliability, and direct invocation of iteration logic.

## **The Simplified Approach**

We eliminated reliance on environment variables and command-line arguments. Instead, iteration logic is directly invoked through straightforward edits to the `main.swift` file. This method is intuitive and easy to maintain.

---

### **Implementation Steps**

#### **1. Editing `main.swift`**
The `main.swift` file serves as the entry point for the application. To execute a specific iteration, simply modify the file to call the corresponding iteration function.

Here is the simplified version of `main.swift`:

```swift
import Vapor

// Entry Point

do {
    let app = try Application(.detect())
    defer { app.shutdown() }

    // Select which iteration to run here
    print("Starting Iteration 1...")
    iteration_1(app: app)  // Replace `iteration_1` with the desired iteration.

    print("Shutting down the application.")
} catch {
    print("Critical error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    exit(1)
}
```

**Steps to Edit**:
1. Open `Sources/main.swift`.
2. Replace `iteration_1(app: app)` with the desired iteration function (e.g., `iteration_2(app: app)`).
3. Save the file.

#### **2. Adding New Iterations**
Each iteration is implemented as a separate Swift file under the `Sources/Iterations` directory. To create a new iteration:

1. **Create the File**:
   - Add a new file under `Sources/Iterations`.
   - Name it `iteration_X.swift`, where `X` is the iteration number.

2. **Define the Iteration Logic**:
   - Each iteration should be defined as a public function:

```swift
import Vapor

public func iteration_X(app: Application) {
    print("Iteration X logic executed.")
    // Add your iteration-specific logic here
}
```

3. **Update `main.swift`**:
   - Call the new iteration function in `main.swift` to test or execute it.

### **Example: Adding Iteration 3**

1. **Create `iteration_3.swift`**:
   ```swift
   import Vapor

   public func iteration_3(app: Application) {
       print("Iteration 3 logic executed.")
       // Add Iteration 3 specific logic here
   }
   ```

2. **Update `main.swift`**:
   ```swift
   import Vapor

   do {
       let app = try Application(.detect())
       defer { app.shutdown() }

       print("Starting Iteration 3...")
       iteration_3(app: app)  // Call the new iteration.

       print("Shutting down the application.")
   } catch {
       print("Critical error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
       exit(1)
   }
   ```

3. **Rebuild and Run**:
   ```bash
   swift build
   swift run CentralSequenceService
   ```

---

### **Benefits of the Simplified Approach**

1. **Clarity and Ease of Use**:
   - No reliance on external configurations.
   - Iterations are clearly defined and invoked directly.

2. **Maintainability**:
   - Adding or modifying iterations requires minimal effort.
   - Changes are localized to `main.swift` and individual iteration files.

3. **Debugging Simplified**:
   - Direct invocation makes it easier to isolate and debug issues.
