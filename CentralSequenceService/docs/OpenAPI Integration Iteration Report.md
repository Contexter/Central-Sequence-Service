# OpenAPI Integration Iteration Report

## **Introduction**

This document outlines the iterative process of integrating an OpenAPI YAML file (`Central-Sequence-Service.yml`) as part of a Vapor application. It captures the challenges faced, learnings gained, and the final decision to leverage Vapor's `FileMiddleware` for serving static files.

---

## **Iteration Overview**

### **Objective**
To make the `Central-Sequence-Service.yml` file available in the Vapor app for:
- Parsing and loading as part of the app's configuration.
- Serving as a publicly accessible resource via HTTP.

### **Initial Approach**
1. **Placement**:
   - The file was to reside in the `Public` directory, aligned with Vapor's convention for static files.
2. **Configuration**:
   - Declared the file as a resource in `Package.swift`:
     ```swift
     resources: [
         .copy("Public/Central-Sequence-Service.yml")
     ]
     ```
   - Integrated logic in `configure.swift` to parse the file using `OpenAPIKit` and `Yams`.

---

## **Challenges Faced**

1. **Missing File**:
   - The `Central-Sequence-Service.yml` file was missing from the `Public` directory due to accidental deletion or misplacement.
   - This led to warnings and errors during builds:
     ```
     Invalid Resource 'Public/Central-Sequence-Service.yml': File not found.
     ```

2. **Swift Package Manager (SPM) Resource Handling**:
   - SPM requires resource files to exist during build time.
   - Any missing or incorrectly referenced files cause build failures or warnings.
   - SPMâ€™s caching mechanism often retained stale references, complicating debugging.

3. **Runtime Assumptions**:
   - The logic in `configure.swift` assumed the fileâ€™s existence without verifying its presence, leading to crashes at runtime when the file was not found.

4. **Build Environment Inconsistencies**:
   - Xcode and SPM behaved differently in terms of detecting file changes.
   - Cleaning and rebuilding were often necessary to resolve stale references.

## **Learnings**

### **1. File Management Matters**
- Resource files must be carefully managed, tracked, and verified in the project structure to avoid issues.
- Any changes (addition, removal, renaming) to resource files must be followed by a clean build.

### **2. Debugging File Issues**
- Using `FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath:)` to check file existence during runtime is critical for debugging resource-related issues.

### **3. SPM Caching Behavior**
- SPM caches references to files aggressively. Cleaning the build (`swift package clean`) and manually removing `.build` artifacts is essential after structural changes.

### **4. Simplicity of `FileMiddleware`**
- Vapor's `FileMiddleware` is an effective way to serve static files from the `Public` directory without declaring them as resources in `Package.swift`.

## **Conclusion: Using `FileMiddleware`**

### **Why `FileMiddleware`?**
1. **Simplifies Static File Handling**:
   - Automatically serves all files in the `Public` directory via HTTP without additional configuration.
2. **Avoids SPM Resource Issues**:
   - No need to declare files in `Package.swift`, eliminating build-time resource errors.
3. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - Changes to files in the `Public` directory are immediately reflected without requiring a rebuild.

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Place File in `Public` Directory**:
   - Ensure the `Central-Sequence-Service.yml` file is present in `CentralSequenceService/Public`.

2. **Enable `FileMiddleware`**:
   - Use Vaporâ€™s `FileMiddleware` to serve files from the `Public` directory. The `configure.swift` file should include:
     ```swift
     app.middleware.use(FileMiddleware(publicDirectory: app.directory.publicDirectory))
     ```

3. **Access File via HTTP**:
   - The file will be available at:
     ```
     http://127.0.0.1:8080/Central-Sequence-Service.yml
     ```

4. **Verify File Presence (Optional)**:
   - Add a debug check to ensure the file exists at runtime:
     ```swift
     let openAPIFilePath = app.directory.publicDirectory + "Central-Sequence-Service.yml"
     if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: openAPIFilePath) {
         print("File exists at: \(openAPIFilePath)")
     } else {
         print("File NOT found at: \(openAPIFilePath)")
     }
     ```

## **Updated `configure.swift`**

Hereâ€™s the final version of `configure.swift` leveraging `FileMiddleware`:

```swift
import Fluent
import FluentSQLiteDriver
import Vapor

// Configures your application
public func configure(_ app: Application) async throws {
    // Serve files from /Public folder
    app.middleware.use(FileMiddleware(publicDirectory: app.directory.publicDirectory))

    // Database configuration
    app.databases.use(DatabaseConfigurationFactory.sqlite(.file("db.sqlite")), as: .sqlite)

    // Add migrations
    app.migrations.add(CreateSequenceRecord())

    // Register routes
    try routes(app)
}
```

---

## **Advantages of the Final Approach**

1. **Streamlined File Handling**:
   - Simplifies the process of serving static files in Vapor.
   - Removes the need to declare resources in `Package.swift`.

2. **Reduced Errors**:
   - Eliminates build-time warnings and runtime crashes due to missing resources.

3. **Dynamic and Flexible**:
   - Files in the `Public` directory are automatically accessible and immediately reflect updates.

---

## **Next Steps**

1. Ensure the `Public` directory contains all required static files, including `Central-Sequence-Service.yml`.
2. Clean and rebuild the project:
   ```bash
   swift package clean
   swift build
   ```
3. Verify the app serves the OpenAPI file via HTTP at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/Central-Sequence-Service.yml`.
