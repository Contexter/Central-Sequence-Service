This document provides guidelines for crafting OpenAPI specifications that align with the functionality of Apple's Swift OpenAPI Generator. By leveraging `operationId` and `tags`, developers can produce well-structured and readable server-side Swift code, particularly for Vapor-based projects.

## Objectives

- Enhance code generation output with organized and readable Swift server files.
- Utilize `operationId` and `tags` strategically to influence the structure and modularity of the generated code.
- Maintain adherence to OpenAPI standards while optimizing for Swift server implementation.

## Key Features of the Apple Swift OpenAPI Generator

Apple's Swift OpenAPI Generator organizes server-side Swift code based on:

1. **`operationId`**:
   - Used to name functions in the generated code, ensuring a consistent and predictable method naming convention.
2. **`tags`**:
   - Defines groupings of related endpoints, influencing how code modules are organized (e.g., separate structs for each tag).
3. **Path-Based Routing**:
   - Supports Vapor's routing structure by generating handlers for each API endpoint.

To optimize for these features, OpenAPI specifications should be designed with clear `operationId` and `tags` usage.

## Recommendations for Writing OpenAPI Specifications

### 1. Use Clear and Unique `operationId`s

`operationId` acts as the function name in the generated Swift code. Ensure each `operationId` is:

- **Descriptive**: Reflects the purpose of the operation (e.g., `generateSequenceNumber`, `reorderElements`, `createVersion`).
- **Unique**: No duplicates across the specification.
- **Predictable**: Follows a consistent naming pattern to ease navigation.

#### Example:

```yaml
paths:
  /sequence:
    post:
      summary: Generate Sequence Number
      operationId: generateSequenceNumber
      tags:
        - SequenceManagement
```

### 2. Organize Related Endpoints Using `tags`

`tags` define logical groupings for related operations. In Swift, these tags translate to modular structs or classes, making the code more readable and maintainable.

- Group endpoints by functionality (e.g., `SequenceManagement`, `VersionManagement`).
- Use meaningful tag names that reflect API domains.

#### Example:

```yaml
paths:
  /sequence:
    post:
      summary: Generate Sequence Number
      operationId: generateSequenceNumber
      tags:
        - SequenceManagement
  /sequence/reorder:
    put:
      summary: Reorder Elements
      operationId: reorderElements
      tags:
        - SequenceManagement
  /sequence/version:
    post:
      summary: Create New Version
      operationId: createVersion
      tags:
        - VersionManagement
```

### 3. Leverage `x-implementation-details` for Non-Swift-Specific Notes

Non-Swift-specific implementation details, such as database or synchronization steps, should be placed in custom extensions (e.g., `x-implementation-details`). This keeps the primary fields concise and focused on code generation.

#### Example:

```yaml
x-implementation-details: |
  Steps:
  1. Validate input.
  2. Compute the sequence number using SQLite.
  3. Insert data into SQLite.
  4. Sync to Typesense, retry on failure.
```

### 4. Maintain Consistent Formatting for Readability

- Align `operationId` and `tags` definitions across the specification.
- Use indentation and comments to ensure the specification is easy to understand and modify.

#### Example:

```yaml
paths:
  /sequence:
    post:
      summary: Generate Sequence Number
      operationId: generateSequenceNumber
      tags:
        - SequenceManagement
      description: |
        Creates a sequence number for an element and synchronizes it with Typesense.
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/SequenceRequest'
      responses:
        '201':
          description: Sequence generated and synchronized.
```

## Benefits for Vapor-Optimized Code

### 1. Clear Function Mapping

Each `operationId` directly maps to a function in the generated Swift code, making it easy for developers to identify and implement specific API endpoints.

### 2. Modular Code Organization

`tags` translate into modularized structs or classes, grouping related endpoints into cohesive units. This improves maintainability and reduces the complexity of large APIs.

### 3. Improved Routing

With `operationId` and `tags`, the generator creates intuitive route handlers for Vapor applications, aligning with Swiftâ€™s routing paradigms.

## Conclusion

By optimizing OpenAPI specifications for Apple's Swift OpenAPI Generator, developers can create structured, maintainable, and Vapor-ready Swift code. Leveraging `operationId` and `tags` effectively ensures the generated code is both functional and developer-friendly.
