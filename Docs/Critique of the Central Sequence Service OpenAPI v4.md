# Critique of the Central Sequence Service OpenAPI v4

As stated initially: *"my feel is that there is a discrepancy in descriptions and actual path / method implementations - ; the whole sqlite and typesense integration is just stated, but not implemented in the form of actual api paths that act upon or act out intension the of the descriptions. This results in a vague definition, which isn't the best communication style for a document that is supposed to be the single source of truth !"*

You’re correct that there’s a discrepancy between what the OpenAPI specification’s descriptions promise (like persisting data to SQLite and synchronizing with Typesense) and what the generated server code or the specification itself actually enforces. Let’s break down where these discrepancies occur and how they might be addressed to create a more cohesive, actionable “source of truth.”

**1. High-Level Concept vs. Concrete Implementation**  
The OpenAPI document currently describes *intents* and *behaviors* rather than providing implementation details or constraints that would guide a developer in creating the underlying logic. For example, it states:

- *“Generates a new sequence number for a specified element type, persists it to an SQLite database, and synchronizes it with Typesense.”*  
- *“Reorders elements ... persists the changes to an SQLite database, and synchronizes the changes with Typesense.”*  
- *“Creates a new version of an element, persists it, and synchronizes it with Typesense.”*

However, these descriptions are more aspirational than prescriptive. They tell *what* the API is supposed to accomplish, but not *how* or *under what conditions*. From an OpenAPI standpoint, the specification only defines input/output schemas, expected response codes, and endpoint URLs. It doesn’t provide internal logic or data modeling details.

**2. Missing Technical Details**  
To make the OpenAPI specification truly the “single source of truth,” you would ideally include:

- **Database Schema Details:**  
  Include references or descriptions of the database tables, fields, and constraints that these operations read from and write to. For example, a section in `components` might define objects or parameters related to the database schema. This would let implementers know exactly which fields are stored and how they relate to the request/response schemas.

- **Synchronization Process:**  
  The description mentions synchronization with Typesense, but the specification does not define how or when this synchronization happens. For example:
  - Which fields are indexed in Typesense?
  - Do failures trigger a retry immediately, or is it asynchronous?
  - Is there a specific field in the request/response that indicates sync status or retry attempts?

  Some of this information might be captured in `components` schemas (like `TypesenseErrorResponse`), but it would be even clearer if the API documented exactly how to detect sync success/failure and how clients should interpret that state.

- **Error Handling and Business Rules:**  
  The error responses define error schemas (`ErrorResponse`, `TypesenseErrorResponse`) but do not detail the business rules that lead to these errors. For example:
  - Under what conditions is a `400 Bad Request` returned? (Missing fields, invalid elementId?)
  - When does `502 Bad Gateway` (failed to synchronize with Typesense) actually occur? Is it immediate or after multiple retries?

  Making these rules explicit in the `description` fields or via standardized error codes helps clients and developers better understand what’s happening.

**3. Clarifying Each Endpoint’s Purpose and Data Flow**  
While the operations have short descriptions, the specification could be improved by outlining a mini workflow in the `description` of each operation. For example, for `/sequence` (POST):
- Explain how the new sequence number is determined (Is it the next integer? Are there rules?)
- State explicitly what happens in the SQLite database (e.g., “Inserts a row into the `sequences` table with the provided `elementId`, `elementType`, and the newly generated sequence number.”)
- State what data is then sent to Typesense for synchronization (e.g., “The newly generated sequence number and its element type are indexed in a Typesense collection named `elements`.”)
- Detail how errors might occur and what the client should do if they receive them.

**4. Improving Accuracy and Clarity**  
To improve the document as a single source of truth:
- **Add Implementation Notes:**  
  Even though the OpenAPI spec is generally about interface, not implementation, consider adding `description` fields or `x-` extension fields that detail the logic. For instance, use `x-implementation-notes` to describe the steps the server is expected to perform.

- **Linking to External Docs:**  
  If the process of updating SQLite or Typesense is too detailed for the OpenAPI file, consider providing a link in the description to more detailed external documentation. For example, `description: "Generates a new sequence number and updates the database. See [Database Schema Docs](https://example.com/db-schema) for details."`

**5. Enforcing Logic with Additional Specification Features**  
OpenAPI primarily focuses on the contract between client and server regarding requests and responses. If you want to more strongly enforce behavior, you might consider:
- **Adding More Specific Response Codes and Schemas:**  
  For example, if the sync fails and triggers a retry, could a `202 Accepted` (partial success, queued for retry) make sense in some workflows, or is it always synchronous?
- **Using `oneOf`, `anyOf`, or `allOf` in schemas** to ensure responses strictly follow certain patterns depending on states.

**In Summary:**

Right now, the descriptions in the OpenAPI specification are conceptual and high-level, implying certain operational steps (SQLite updates, Typesense sync) that aren’t reflected in the actual schema constraints or data fields. To improve communication and establish the document as a real “source of truth,” you should:

- Add explicit details about the database and indexing processes.
- Clearly define the conditions under which each error response occurs.
- Provide richer descriptions or external references so developers understand how to implement the logic behind the endpoints.

This will ensure the OpenAPI specification isn’t just describing what the API *conceptually* does, but also how it should be integrated, tested, and maintained—making it a far better source of truth.

After setting up the Apple Swift OpenAPI generator plugin, the shortcomings become even more apparent. The generated Swift code offers a concrete view into the API’s structure, producing typed endpoints and model definitions directly from the specification. This generated code reveals a tangible disconnect: it accurately reflects the documented endpoints and schemas but highlights that the specification itself lacks the necessary detail for true spec-driven development. Instead of guiding implementers smoothly into a production-ready application, the specification leaves gaps in logic and data handling that are not addressed by the code or the documentation. Ultimately, ensuring that the OpenAPI document is precise, detailed, and internally consistent will make the generated code a reliable and productive asset for developers.
