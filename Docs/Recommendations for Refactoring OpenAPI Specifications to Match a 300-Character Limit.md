# Recommendations for Refactoring OpenAPI Specifications to Match a 300-Character Limit

This document outlines strategies for refactoring OpenAPI specifications to adhere to a 300-character limit for `description` fields. These recommendations aim to maintain developer-instructive detail while ensuring compatibility with machine learning models and linter constraints.

## Objectives

1. **Concisely describe functionality**: Ensure that `description` fields communicate the primary purpose and behavior of endpoints.
2. **Retain critical details**: Preserve essential developer instructions and technical workflows.
3. **Enhance usability**: Balance machine interpretability and human readability.

## Refactoring Strategies

### 1. **Focus on the Primary Purpose in**`description`**

The `description` field should summarize the endpointâ€™s purpose and key behavior. Avoid including implementation steps, error handling details, or workflows.

#### Example

**Original**:

```yaml
  description: >
    This endpoint generates a sequence number for a specified element type by querying SQLite, inserting a record, and synchronizing it with Typesense.
```

**Refactored**:

```yaml
  description: >
    Generates a sequence number for an element and syncs it with Typesense.
```

### 2. **Leverage Custom Extensions for Details**

Use custom OpenAPI extensions like `x-implementation-details` or `x-notes` for detailed workflows, technical steps, or additional context. These fields can hold supplementary information without cluttering `description`.

#### Example

```yaml
x-implementation-details: |
  Workflow:
  1. Validate input (`elementType`, `elementId`, `comment`).
  2. Compute `sequenceNumber` by querying SQLite.
  3. Insert into `sequences` table.
  4. Sync `elementId` and `sequenceNumber` with Typesense.
  5. Retry once on failure.
```

### 3. **Use External References for Documentation**

Link to external resources, such as GitHub documentation, for detailed guides and explanations. This reduces verbosity in the OpenAPI file and provides developers with rich resources for implementation.

#### Example

```yaml
  description: >
    Generates a sequence number for an element. See details in [GitHub](https://github.com/Contexter/Central-Sequence-Service).
```

### 4. **Reuse Documentation with Components**

Define reusable `components` for common workflows, summaries, or notes. Reference these components across multiple operations to reduce duplication.

#### Example

**Component**:

```yaml
x-workflow-summaries:
  GenerateSequence:
    summary: >
      Steps for generating a sequence number and syncing with Typesense.
    details: |
      1. Input validation.
      2. SQLite record insertion.
      3. Typesense synchronization with retry.
```

**Referenced in Path**:

```yaml
  description: >
    Generates a sequence number and syncs it with Typesense.
    See `x-workflow-summaries.GenerateSequence` for details.
```

### 5. **Adopt Uniform Conciseness**

Ensure all `description` fields adhere to a consistent tone and level of detail. Focus on the "what" rather than the "how."

#### Example

**Before**:

```yaml
  description: >
    Updates sequence numbers of elements by modifying SQLite entries and synchronizing updates with Typesense. Includes a retry mechanism on failure.
```

**After**:

```yaml
  description: >
    Updates sequence numbers and syncs them with Typesense.
```

### 6. **Prioritize Critical Information**

In cases where detailed steps cannot fit, prioritize critical workflows (e.g., validation and primary action) and omit secondary details.

## Example Refactored Endpoint

### Original

```yaml
  description: >
    This endpoint generates a sequence number for a specified element type by querying SQLite, inserting a record, and synchronizing it with Typesense. Includes error handling and retries.
```

### Refactored

```yaml
  description: >
    Generates a sequence number for an element and syncs with Typesense.
  x-implementation-details: |
    Steps:
    1. Validate input (`elementType`, `elementId`, `comment`).
    2. Compute `sequenceNumber` by querying SQLite.
    3. Insert into `sequences` table.
    4. Sync `elementId` and `sequenceNumber` with Typesense.
    5. Retry once on failure.
```

## Conclusion

By adhering to these recommendations, OpenAPI specifications can maintain rich, developer-friendly detail while conforming to constraints like the 300-character limit. This balance ensures usability for both human developers and automated systems such as GPT models.
